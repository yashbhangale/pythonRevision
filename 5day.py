#typecasting in python 
#converts one data type to another
a = "1"
c = 1
b = "2"
d = 2
print(a + b)
print(c + d)
print(int(a) + int(b))

# types of typecasting
# explicit typecasting and implicit typecasting
# explicit typecasting means you have to tell the compiler to convert the data type
# implicit typecasting means the compiler will automatically convert the data type
