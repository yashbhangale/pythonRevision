 Problem statement

Take the length(L) and breadth(B) of the rectangle as input and find its area.
Note:

Length and breadth must be an integer value and the area will always be in the range of integers.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints:

1 <= L, B <= 10Ë†2

Sample Input 1:

4 20

Sample Output 1:

80

Explanation of Sample Input 1:

Length of the rectangle is 4 and breadth is 20. 
Hence the area of the rectangle is (length*breadth). 
So the answer is 4*20=80.

def calculate_rectangle_area(length, breadth):
    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = length * breadth
    return area

# Input: Take the length and breadth as input
length, breadth = map(int, input().split())

# Check if the input values satisfy the constraints
if 1 <= length <= 100**2 and 1 <= breadth <= 100**2:
    # Calculate and print the area of the rectangle
    result = calculate_rectangle_area(length, breadth)
    print(result)
